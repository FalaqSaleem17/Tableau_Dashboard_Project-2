### 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
- The data cleaning and transformation process was conducted in Microsoft Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency across all fields. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing or incomplete entries, and standardizing vehicle make and model names.
- The dataset was also structured to align with visualization requirements, enabling seamless integration into Tableau for dynamic filtering and insightful analysis.
<br><br>
### 3. Data Analysis
- The analysis reveals significant insights into electric vehicle adoption trends across the United States. Tesla dominates the market, accounting for over half of all EVs, with Model Y and Model 3 being the most prevalent models. The majority of vehicles are Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), comprising 77.62% of the total, while Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) make up 22.38%. Washington state leads in vehicle registrations with a substantial margin. The average electric range across all vehicles stands at 67.88 km, indicating moderate driving capabilities. Additionally, a notable portion of vehicles—over 46%—have unknown CAFV eligibility, highlighting a potential area for data enrichment and policy focus.

## Data Visualization
Dashboard Development

The dashboard was developed using Tableau, focusing on delivering an interactive and insightful user experience. Key design principles such as clarity, usability, and visual hierarchy were applied to ensure that stakeholders can easily navigate and interpret the data. Visual elements include bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and geographic maps, all enhanced with dynamic filters for state, make, model, and EV type. The development process involved integrating cleaned Excel data, defining calculated fields for metrics like electric range and CAFV eligibility, and customizing tooltips and color schemes to highlight critical insights. The result is a comprehensive and visually compelling tool for analyzing electric vehicle trends across the United States.

## Key Insights
-Tesla's Market Leadership: Tesla dominates the EV market with over 52% share, led by its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles.
- BEVs Outpace PHEVs: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) constitute the majority of the fleet at 77.62%, indicating a shift toward fully electric models.
- Regional Concentration: Washington state records the highest number of EV registrations, highlighting regional adoption disparities.
- Moderate Electric Range: The average electric range across all vehicles is 67.88 km, suggesting room for technological advancements.
- CAFV Data Gaps: A significant portion (46.32%) of vehicles have unknown Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility status, signaling potential gaps in data reporting or classification.
- Year-on-Year Growth: Consistent growth in EV registrations reflects rising consumer interest and the impact of supportive policies and incentives.
<br><br>

## Strategic Recommendations
Enhance Data Completeness:
- Improve data collection and reporting processes, particularly around CAFV eligibility, to support better policy evaluation and incentive targeting.

Promote BEV Adoption:
- With BEVs already leading, further investment in charging infrastructure and range improvement can accelerate the transition to fully electric vehicles.

Support Regional Expansion:
- Encourage EV adoption in underrepresented states through localized incentives, public awareness campaigns, and infrastructure development.

Encourage Model Diversity:
- Promote a broader range of affordable and high-performance EV models to reduce market concentration and enhance consumer choice.

Leverage Market Leaders: 
- Collaborate with dominant manufacturers like Tesla to drive innovation, public engagement, and partnership opportunities in clean mobility initiatives.

Monitor and Evaluate Policy Impact: 
- Continuously track year-over-year growth and regional trends to assess the effectiveness of current policies and make data-driven adjustments.
